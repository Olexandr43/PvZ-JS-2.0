## 🏡 Key Features of This Mod


### Major New Features

*   **Full Save/Load System:** The game state can be saved at any time from the pause menu and loaded from the main selection screen, preserving all plants, zombies, and wave progress.
*   **Zombie Almanac:** An in-game Almanac is now available from the plant selection screen. It tracks all encountered zombies, allowing players to view their stats, descriptions, and abilities.
*   **Pre-Game Plant Selection:** Players no longer start with a fixed set of plants. A new **Plant Selection Screen** appears before the game starts, where players must choose a limited deck of plants from a larger library to use in the upcoming match. This adds a significant layer of strategy.
*   **Lawnmowers:** The iconic last line of defense has been added. Each lane is protected by a lawnmower (`🚜`) that will activate upon the first zombie reaching the house, clearing the entire lane once.
*   **Shovel Functionality:** Players can now remove misplaced or unwanted plants using a Shovel (`⛏️`). This is selectable from the plant bar in-game.
*   **Victory Condition:** There is a final wave (Wave 20), and defeating all zombies in that wave now triggers a **Victory sequence**, complete with a collectible trophy (`🏆`) and a victory screen.
*   **Debug/Sandbox Mode:** A hidden zombie spawner has been added, which can be toggled with the 'Z' key. This allows players to manually spawn any type of zombie on any tile for testing or fun.
*   **Custom Dialog System:** Replaces native browser alerts with themed, non-blocking modals for a smoother user experience.

### Core Gameplay & Balance Changes

1.  **Plant Rebalancing and Reworks**
    *   **Chomper (🌿):**
        *   **New "Chewing" Mechanic:** After eating a zombie, the Chomper is vulnerable and must "chew" for 42 seconds before it can eat again.
        *   **Bite Attack:** It cannot eat Gargantuars, but it will now bite them for a small amount of damage.
    *   **Sun Economy:**
        *   Sunflowers now produce **50 sun**.
        *   Twin Sunflowers produce **100 sun**.
        *   Sun falling from the sky is now worth **25**.

2.  **Wave Progression Rework**
    *   The wave system has been completely redesigned. Waves are now generated using a **point-buy system**, where the game uses a "budget" for each wave to purchase a varied and increasingly difficult group of zombies from an available pool.
    *   The primary way to advance is by **defeating all zombies** from the current wave. A backup timer also ensures the game progresses.

3. **Advanced Game Engine:** 
    *   The underlying code for game events and timers has been rewritten to be more robust, ensuring all timed events (cooldowns, spawns, etc.) are correctly paused and scaled with the game speed, fixing major bugs in the original.

4.  **UI and UX Enhancements**
    *   **Wave Counter Position:** The wave counter has been moved to the **bottom-right** for better visibility.
    *   **Sun Collection Animation:** Sun now visually **flies across the screen** into the sun counter for better feedback.
